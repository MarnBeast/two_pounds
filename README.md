# two_pounds
This project was mostly for experimenting with Rust, and trying to solve the challenge listed at https://projecteuler.net/problem=31. This was my first Project Euler, and I think I kind of missed the point. I wanted to use Rust because I was interested in learning the language, but I took an object oriented approach which in retrospect was most likely a mistake, especially in a largely functional language like Rust. This is a cautionary tale.
